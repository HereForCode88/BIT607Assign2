                <h3>About the Owners</h3>
                <p>The owners of Haukai Restaurant, located in the picturesque Bay of Islands, are dedicated entrepreneurs with a passion for creating a unique dining experience. They have built their restaurant business from the ground up, focusing on offering a blend of flavors and cultures that cater to both locals and tourists.</p>

                <p>Currently, the restaurant operates in the evenings from Wednesday to Sunday, serving a diverse menu that combines traditional Māori and Pākeha cuisine, complemented by a selection of beverages. The owners are not just culinary enthusiasts; they are also keen on incorporating elements of Māori culture into their restaurant experience. This includes practices like karakia, which blesses the food and adds cultural depth to the dining experience.</p>
